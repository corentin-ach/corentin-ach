## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

Hello,

I am a software engineer with over 3 years of front-end development.
I used to work for international startups, especially for substantial clients in the agricultural field.
I like to solve complex problems while keeping a creative eye. I am front-end focus, but I did also back-end development.

I can help you now in any web project! I have a special expertise for cartography website, but it's not the only one. I can also build :
- landing page
- dashboard
- charts and tools to analyse data
- chat message website
- authentification, login
- responsive mobile view

I am the developer you need if you're looking for someone who can build project from scratch, develop new features, for short-term or long-term development. Feel free to reach out! :)

Thank you,

Corentin
